  <https://github.com/xpc-wg/xpchain/issues>

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/XPChain-Qt` (on Mac).

Compatibility
==============

XPChain Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer (Windows XP is not supported).

XPChain Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.
